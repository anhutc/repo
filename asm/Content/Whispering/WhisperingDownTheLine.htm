        <p>Passing of the data for an individual board (ink spots, board barcode, board status, Traceability data) from one machine to the next.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>The ink spots of a board are only measured on the first station in processing area 1. The ink spot data determined in this way is passed to the second processing area or to the downstream stations.  (Default)<br />Prerequisite: "Whisper down the line" has been enabled in the programming system.<br />Caution: Disabling this option can lead to performance loss or to partially assembled boards in the event of ink spots that are close to the tolerances.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>If the board is canceled during production, the downstream machines must transport this board through to a machine where the board can be removed from the output section, and must not assemble the board. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Passing of board barcodes from one placement machine to the next.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Passing of the traceability data:<br />A station sends all traceability data (what component from what batch was placed on what board using what machine?) to the traceability service.</p>
                <p>In order to do this, board barcodes are indispensable in order to allow the traceability service to uniquely assign the data received from the station to a single instance of a board. Because the barcode is passed between the individual stations, a barcode scanner is now only required on the first machine of a sub-line.</p>
