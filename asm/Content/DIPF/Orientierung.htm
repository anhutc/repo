        <p class="PopupHeading"><a name="kanchor230"></a>Orientation</p>
        <p class="PopupText">Components which are rotated by 180째, 90째, 60째 or 45째 in the feeder cannot be measured and therefore also not be placed, as their actual position deviates too much from the expected position. Such components are rejected. When placing expensive components, this should, however, be avoided wherever possible. For this reason, a function has been provided which allows components to be placed which are lying at a different angle.</p>
        <p class="PopupText">&#160;</p>
        <p class="PopupText">If the system detects that a component is rotated, a warning to this effect is issued. This may be an indication of incorrect setup data. It is necessary to check the settings.</p>
        <p class="PopupText">&#160;</p>
        <p class="PopupText">If orientation detection is enabled (2, 4, 6 or 8) and if the system detects that a component is rotated, it is possible to correct the rotation of the component before placement to allow it to be placed correctly. </p>
        <p class="PopupText">In the Twin Head, however, this additional check can lead to significant delays. </p>
        <p class="PopupText">On the C&amp;P20 head, it is possible that placement accuracy will be negatively impacted if the component is not presented in the expected orientation.</p>
        <p class="PopupText">&#160;</p>
        <p class="so">Recommendation:</p>
        <p class="PopupText">Only activate orientation detection if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">you expect that components may be presented with an incorrect orientation in the feeder (components in trays),</li>
            <li value="2">it is more important to place all components than to achieve the shortest possible placement times,</li>
            <li value="3">the arrangement of the leads allows the orientation to be determined.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="PopupText">&#160;</p>
        <p class="PopupText">If orientation detection is enabled, make sure that inspection mode has not been disabled.</p>
