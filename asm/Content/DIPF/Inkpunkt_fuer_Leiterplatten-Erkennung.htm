            <h1>Ink spot for PCB recognition</h1>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>If two PCBs positioned immediately behind each other are assembled, 
 this is known as a "combined PCB". During placement, both boards 
 are treated as a single board. A <span style="font-weight: bold;">special 
 ink spot for PCB recognition</span> is required in order to determine 
 whether both boards are actually in the processing conveyor, since ink 
 spot recognition is carried out before the fiducials are measured, which 
 means that different tolerances have to be compensated for. For the same 
 reason, the evaluation methods for the <a href="Dipf_PCB_DETECTION_PATTERN.htm">taught 
 ink spot</a> are also limited: Only the "mean grayscale" method 
 with fixed parameters is available. The ink spot on the board must be 
 at least 6 mm x 6 mm in size in order to compensate for any possible tolerances.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>The ink spot type must be set in SIPLACE Pro.</p>
            <p>A maximum of 1 ink spot for PCB recognition is permitted for each pair 
 of boards. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../Images/ACHTUNG.jpg" style="border: none;width: 37px;height: 37px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="37" height="37" border="0" />The 
 location of this ink spot must be specified in SIPLACE Pro. </p>
            <p>This should be a clearly recognizable position at which the two adjoining 
 boards that are to be assembled simultaneously are clearly different. 
 If, for instance, the first board has a circular fiducial at the specified 
 location and the second board has a via, this can lead to an error.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Recommendation: Specify a defined structure (e.g. a fiducial), i.e. 
 a <a href="Dipf_PCB_DETECTION.htm">synthetic ink spot</a>.</p>
