        <h1><a name="kanchor2722"></a>Combined PCB</h1>
        <p>The combined PCB option allows two boards that are positioned immediately behind each other to be assembled simultaneously. The two boards must be described as a single board in SIPLACE Pro. Optimization of placement performance can be expected in particular in cases where one of the two boards only has a few placement positions (e.g. top and bottom of one board).

 

When the first board is moved into the processing area, the clamping bar is lowered slightly to prevent the second board from passing over the first. The first board is stopped by a small lug in the clamping bar. The next board stops against the first and both are then clamped. After placement, the two boards are separated slightly by different conveyor speeds as they pass from one conveyor to the next to prevent the second board from passing over the first. 

 

This mode is indicated by the way the boards are shown in the production view:
