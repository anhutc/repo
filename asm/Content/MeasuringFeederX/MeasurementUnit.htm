        <p>Before components are picked up from a feeder and placed, their electrical value can be checked to ensure that the components in the feeder are as specified.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to carry out the check at defined intervals, e.g. every 100th component, to ensure that there are no "fake components" on a tape reel.</p>
        <p>It is possible to check the capacitance, resistance, on-state voltage/polarity (with diodes) and, if necessary, the inductance of a component.</p>
        <p>The first component of a feeder is picked up, pressed onto a contact area by the placement head and tested.</p>
        <p>The contact area is made up of 2 contact plates with a gap of 0.2 mm between them. </p>
        <p>The components can be tested along this gap. Depending on the size of the components, the measurement can take place at different places along the contact area.</p>
        <p class="So">The components are to be tested:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>every time the feeder is replaced,</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>after any potential change of batch:&#160;After a "torn foil" error, after any splicing operation or any change of waffle pack tray.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Verification period: In the programming system, you can specify the number of components after which the measurement is to be repeated.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">Verification sequence: In the programming system, you can specify a sequence of intervals at which components are to be inspected. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="So">Reference run:</p>
        <p>There are two fiducials on each of the contact plates. These are measured using the board camera to determine the exact position of the contact plates.</p>
        <p>This is necessary in order to allow the placement head to precisely position the component to be tested.</p>
        <p class="So">Size of components that can be measured using the SIPLACE&#160;MeasuringFeeder X: </p>
        <p>0.6 mm x 0.3 mm through 6.0 mm x 3.2 mm.</p>
