        <p>Inkspots are used for identifying boards or panels. This marking enables the machine to decide during placement whether a board should have components placed on it or if it should be omitted. There is a choice of stickers, ink marks, holes, punched holes or circuit structures as ink spots. It is, however also possible to create ink spots by drawing over structures with a marker pen.</p>
        <p>Before an ink spot can be used as a decision criterion, a model of the ink spot must be created, describing its geometrical form.</p>
        <p>If it is not possible to describe the geometrical form, the <a href="Teachen_eines_Inkpunktes.htm">ink spot is taught</a>, i.e. the structure and orientation of the ink spot are captured by the board camera and the data derived from this is stored. It is necessary to describe both ink spots identifying panels which are to have components placed on them ("go" case) and ink spots identifying panels which are not to have components placed on them ("no-go" case). In the event that an ink spot cannot be clearly identified during placement (system is uncertain), the operator decides how to deal with panels which have not been definitively flagged. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">The standard method is to use geometrically described ink spots.</p>
        <p><a href="Probleme_bei_der_Auswertung_von_Inkpunkten.htm">Problems when evaluating ink spots.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/ACHTUNG.jpg" style="border: none;width: 37px;height: 37px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="37" height="37" border="0" /> The structures must be of a good quality:</p>
        <p>The machine does not come to a standstill if a structure is not found. Instead, the panel or board is not assembled. If it happens that "good" panels or boards are not assembled because the structure was not recognized, you can adjust the settings for the <a href="../Erkennungs-Parameter/Manip_ManipSfParams.htm">algorithm parameters</a>. Then test whether a "bad" panel or board is also actually omitted.</p>
        <p>The quality shown does not correspond to the measured quality of the structure, but is calculated from the discrepancy between the measured quality and the <span class="MCPopup"><a href="javascript:void(0);" MadCap:src="../Erkennungs-Parameter/SF_Mindestqualitaet_der_Erkennung.htm" onclick="FMCPopup( event, this ); return false;" class="MCPopupSpot">minimum quality</a></span><br />The greater the discrepancy between the two values, the more reliable the quality is for ink spots, i.e. the quality shown is high.</p>
        <p>During placement, the board is loaded and ink spot recognition is carried out. Then the stored data is compared with the actual ink spot and a decision is made regarding whether components should be placed on the panel or not. </p>
        <p class="So">The following work has to be carried out:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="number" value="1">Start inkspot processing.</li>
            <li class="number" value="2">Ink spot description: Specifying the size and shape of the ink spot or<br />	Teaching ink spots using board camera images.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Three different methods are currently used for classifying taught ink spots. An <a href="Welches_Verfahren_fuer_welchen_Inkpunkt_.htm">appropriate method</a> has to be selected depending on the nature of the ink spot.</p>
