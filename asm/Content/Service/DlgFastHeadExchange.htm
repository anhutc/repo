        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Exchanged heads</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Each exchanged head is selected here for the additional steps required (see the following sample configuration).</p>
        <p class="Button_text">On certain machines, it is possible to replace not only the head, but also the gantry.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxNotSelected32x32.png" style="width: 32px;height: 32px;" /> The head or gantry has not been replaced. (Default setting)</p>
        <p class="Button_text">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected32x32.png" style="width: 32px;height: 32px;" />  The head or gantry has been replaced.</p>
        <p class="Button_text_bottom">If the system automatically detects that placement heads have been replaced, these are selected for calibration and shown in orange in the diagram. These heads must be calibrated.</p>
        <p>As soon as a head or gantry is selected for which different calibration options are available, the following selection options are displayed:</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Calibration type</p>
        <p class="Butt">Standard calibration</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Completely calibrates the head. The calibration data stored in the head EEPROM are not used.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Brief calibration</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Calibrates the component camera(s) and segment 1. The calibration data stored in the head EEPROM are used for this.</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">It is not possible to select the calibration type for the Twin Head, as it is always necessary to perform a complete calibration on the Twin Head.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Next</p>
        <p class="Button_text_bottom">Switches to the relevant view for the next work step for the exchanged head (see description below).&#160;</p>
        <p class="Group_Box">Adjust nozzle changer data (optional)</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">This view is only shown if not all nozzles were returned before the head is exchanged.</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">The nozzles on the head must be returned to the correct garages of the nozzle changer manually and you must then confirm that the garages are full.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">You can do this for each individual garage or for all garages at once by checking the <b class="button_Char">All garages have been refilled</b> box.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Next</p>
        <p class="Button_text_bottom">Switches to the relevant view for the next work step for the exchanged head (see description below).&#160;</p>
        <p class="Group_Box">Prerequisites for reference run and calibration</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Make sure that the required calibration nozzles are present on all segments and that the calibration tools are in the appropriate calibration pockets.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Not all calibration tools can be provided at the same time.</p>
        <p class="Button_text_bottom">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected32x32.png" /> If insufficient calibration tools are available, it is also possible to perform calibration step by step.<br />To do this, specify the position in the machine at which a calibration tool is available.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Start</p>
        <p class="Button_text_bottom">Carries out a reference run and then calibrates the placement head.</p>
        <p>After calibration, the calibration nozzles are returned to the nozzle changer. If this is not possible, they are rejected and must be removed from the machine along with the calibration tools.</p>
