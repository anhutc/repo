        <p>The purpose of the MAC test is to determine the accuracy of the machine on the basis of the reproducibility of placement of calibration tools at a predefined position by individual segments. The calibration tools should be placed at the same position by each of the selected segments. The smaller the discrepancy between the measured positions for each segment, the more accurately the machine places components.</p>
        <p>When the MAC test is carried out, a calibration tool is picked up from the calibration tool pocket and placed on a fixed glass plate with vacuum holes and fiducials, where it is measured. To prevent the calibration tool from slipping on the glass plate, it is held in place by vacuum after it has been placed.</p>
        <p>This operation is repeated with each <a href="DlgPlaceHeadMACSelectSegments.htm">selected segment</a> for the selected <a href="DlgPlaceHeadMACSetOptions.htm">number of measurements</a>.</p>
        <p>Placement accuracy can be determined by measuring the position of the placed calibration tool relative to the surrounding fiducials. To do this, images from the board camera are evaluated using a special measurement procedure.</p>
