        <p class="Achtung">The following settings are for test purposes only!</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Watchdog options</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">In order to provide a meaningful bug report if the machine comes to a standstill during an endurance run, the report is created automatically as soon as the X or Y axis of the selected gantry does not move during the specified interval. </p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Select the gantry for which you want to monitor movement of the X and Y axes.</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected32x32.png" /> Monitoring is enabled. </p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Monitoring can be started by selecting the axes when an endurance run or the "Simulate placement of components"&#160;function is started and as soon as all the axes are moving.</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Monitoring is terminated if the machine is stopped or a bug report is automatically generated.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Timeout [s]</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Time interval in seconds: If a selected axis does not move after this time has elapsed, a bug report is created automatically.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Hint: In the case of "Simulate placement of components", the time interval set here must be sufficiently large to accommodate the longest pauses for an axis defined in the placement program. Otherwise, a bug report is created and monitoring is terminated.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Default: 300 s.</p>
        <p class="Butt_oben_Rahmen">Simulate placement of components</p>
        <p class="Button_text">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected32x32.png" /> The placement operations are performed for test purposes, but no components are placed (dry run).</p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Dry run mode <img src="../Images/arrowDown_30x30.png" style="width: 30;height: 30;" /></p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Dry run</p>
        <p class="Button_text"> The placement process is executed for test purposes without placing components. </p>
        <p class="Button_text">Feeder position recognition is also carried out and communication with the required feeders is tested. However, no components are provided by the feeders.</p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Simulate setup</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Dry run without feeders:</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Feeder position recognition is not carried out and communication with the feeders is not tested. </p>
        <p class="Button_text">This option can be enabled if not all feeders or no feeders are physically present or if no component tables are present.</p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Use available feeders <small style="font-weight: normal;" class="Nur_sichtbar">(Only displayed for the "SIPLACE service" activity level.)</small></p>
        <p class="Button_text">A dry run can be performed irrespective of whether individual feeders or component tables are present.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Feeder position recognition is carried out for the available feeders and communication is tested. Missing feeders are ignored.</p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Board handling        <img src="../Images/arrowDown_30x30.png" style="width: 30;height: 30;" /></p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Standard board transport</p>
        <p class="Button_text">The board moves through the machine in the same way as when components are placed.</p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">No board transport</p>
        <p class="Button_text">The board remains in the processing section and is not transported on.</p>
        <p class="Butt_eingerückt">Cyclic board transport</p>
        <p class="Button_text">During placement simulation, the board is moved from the input section into the placement section and then into the output section. When each cycle is complete, the board is transported back into the input section and the process starts again.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">This option is used to test clamping, positioning and transport of the boards during the placement test.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Automatically set full</p>
        <p class="Button_text">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected32x32.png" /> If a simulated feeder runs out of components, i.e. if the components that were theoretically present are set to 0, the number of components for a full feeder is automatically assumed. </p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Endurance run with components</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Overnight endurance run: A board is moved in and a corresponding placement job is specified from SIPLACE&#160;Pro. After all the components have been placed, the placement head picks them up again and returns them to the appropriate waffle pack tray. The machine then starts to place the components again.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Return placed components after finishing board</p>
        <p class="Button_text_bottom">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected32x32.png" /> The components are returned to the waffle pack tray.</p>
        <p class="Standard">Default:&#160;The options are deactivated: <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxNotSelected32x32.png" /></p>
