        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Entire machine functions</p>
        <p class="Butt">Overall reference run</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Before the stations can start assembly, the gantries and placement heads have to perform a reference run. During the reference run all axes move to their zero points. The head height and the nozzle offsets are measured and a vacuum test is performed. </p>
        <p class="Butt">Move all boards to the output section of the machine</p>
        <p class="Button_text">All boards in the machine are transported to the output section and must be removed by hand.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Move gantries to preset position...</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Opens a<a href="DlgManualOperationsEntireMachineClass.htm"> dialog box</a> in which you can specify the position to which the gantry is to move:</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Park position, service position, setup position or conveyor edge.</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Gantry functions <br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; color: #696969;">(Is only shown for machines on which the gantries cannot be moved to the service position simultaneously.)</span></p>
        <p class="Butt">Move gantry to service position</p>
        <p class="Button_text">When a gantry is in the service position, it is possible to perform work on the placement head.</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top" style="font-weight: bold;">Operating hours</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Shows the number of hours the station software has been booted since initial commissioning.</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top" style="font-weight: bold;">Component count    <span style="color: #a9a9a9; font-weight: normal;">(Only appears if no component counter (hardware) is fitted to the machine.)</span></p>
        <p class="Button_text">Shows the number of components placed on this machine to date (the value is regularly saved in the EEPROM of the I/O module.)</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Caution: If I/O modules are exchanged between machines, the counter values are also exchanged. This is indicated by a warning issued at the GUI.</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Vacuum pump functions<br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; color: #696969;">(Only shown for machines on which a frequency-controlled vacuum pump is present.)</span></p>

            <img src="../Images/RadiobuttonSelected32x32_25x25.png" style="width: 25;height: 25;" />Shows the current status:</p>
        <p class="Butt">On</p>
        <p class="Button_text">The vacuum pump is switched on.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Off</p>
        <p class="Button_text">The vacuum pump is switched off and no vacuum is being generated (power-saving mode).</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">Press the appropriate radio button to change the status.</p>
        <p class="Achtung">Caution: The vacuum pump may only be switched off if there are no more components on the placement heads.</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Hardware start button behavior</p>
        <p class="Butt">Start production automatically</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Recommended setting during production: Automatic mode.</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Pressing the Start button starts production immediately.        </p>
        <p class="Butt">Do not change production status</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Recommended setting during service activities:</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Pressing the start button does not start production, but only closes the electrical circuit. </p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Hardware stop button behavior</p>
        <p class="Butt">Stop immediately</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Default: </p>
        <p class="Button_text">Pressing the Stop button stops production immediately. The protective covers can be opened immediately. Components that have already been picked up remain on the placement heads.        </p>
        <p class="Butt">Stop after placement cycle<small class="Nur_sichtbar"> (can only be selected on machines with a protective cover locking mechanism)</small></p>
        <p class="Button_text">Recommended setting if extremely high components are to be placed in the job:</p>
        <p class="Button_text">Pressing the Stop button only stops production after all components that have been picked up have been placed. The protective covers can only be opened after the current placement cycle is complete.</p>
        <p class="Group_Box_Top">Run options</p>
        <p class="Butt_Text_links">The following settings are only designed for use during testing and would lead to considerable delays during productive placement operation.</p>
        <p class="Butt">Cycle mode <span style="font-weight: normal;">(for test purposes only)</span></p>
        <p class="Button_text">
            <img src="../Images/General/CheckboxSelected16x16.png" /> On: The Start button must be pressed each time the machine moves a board.</p>
