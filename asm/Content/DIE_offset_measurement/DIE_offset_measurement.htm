        <h1><a name="kanchor183"></a>Front/back offset measurement </h1>
        <p>With fan-out panel level packaging, silicon dies are picked up from a wafer and the <a href="DIE attach process/DieAttach.htm">die attach process</a> is then used to place them on a larger panel with the electrical connections on top.</p>
        <p>Inaccurate or oblique cut edges mean that determination of the position using the outline alone is inadequate for high-precision placement of dies. A new measurement step has therefore been introduced in which selected dies are measured both from the bottom and from the top.</p>
        <p class="Standard_Hinweis">The aim of front/back offset measurement is to be able to place the dies as precisely as possible, taking account of the electrical connections on the top surface.</p>
        <p>The SIPLACE Wafer System or the wafer map can be used to specify which dies of a wafer are to be subject to this measurement. The average value for X and Y determined for these dies during additional measurement is used as the offset for all other dies of this wafer during placement.</p>
        <p>A prerequisite for this is that a specified percentage of the measurements was able to be performed successfully. If the offset of a die is determined to be greater than the specified positional tolerance, the die is marked as an outlier and rejected. This measurement is not taken into account when determining the offset.</p>
