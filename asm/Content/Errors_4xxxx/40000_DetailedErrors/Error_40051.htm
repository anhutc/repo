        <p class="Ursache">No acknowledgment was received that the board has arrived in the Shuttle Extension, even though the board has left the upstream machine.</p>
        <p class="Maßnahme">Visually check the position in the machine at which the board is located and choose this position from the drop-down menu <img src="../../Images/DownArrow32x32_18x18.png" style="width: 18;height: 18;"></img>. Then continue placement by confirming the relevant action.</p>
        <p class="Ursache"><b class="button_Char">Board removed</b>: The board has been removed by hand.</p>
        <p class="Ursache"><b class="button_Char">Board is completely in Shuttle Extension</b>: Although the board is located completely in the Shuttle Extension, the sensor has not triggered.</p>
        <p class="Ursache"><b class="button_Char">Board is in previous machine</b>: The board is still in the upstream machine or in an intermediate position between the machine and the Shuttle Extension. An attempt is made to move it into the Shuttle Extension.</p>
        <p class="Maßnahme">First make sure that the board can be moved freely in the conveyor.</p>
        <p class="Standard_Hinweis">Note: If the board does not move from the current position, open the protective cover of the Shuttle Extension and push the board up to the sensor.</p>
        <p class="Ursache"><b class="button_Char">Board is in machine</b>: The board is still in the machine to which the Shuttle Extension is assigned or in an intermediate position between the two machines. An attempt is made to move it into the Shuttle Extension.</p>
        <p class="Maßnahme">First make sure that the board can be moved freely in the conveyor.</p>
        <p class="Ursache">If problem still exists:</p>
