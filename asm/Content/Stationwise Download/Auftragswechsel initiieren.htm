        <h1><a name="kanchor2860"></a>Initiating a station-wise job change </h1>
        <p class="So">How to carry out a job change:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Enter the new job at the SIPLACE&#160;Pro Line Control user interface and select the "Station-wise Download" option.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Go to the first station of the line, wait until the last board of the old job (job A) has entered the station and then click the button <img src="../Images/StationwiseDownload/SwdConfirmLastBoard_Button.PNG" />. </p>
                <p>The conveyor interface is locked: <img src="../Images/Production/Block_orange.PNG" /></p>
                <p>As long as the following button is displayed, you can undo the action by clicking the button again: <img src="../Images/StationwiseDownload/SwdConfirmLastBoard_ButtonPressed.PNG" /> .<br />The input section is then blocked for the new boards and the new job B is not yet active: <img src="../Images/StationwiseDownload/SwdScheduleB.png" />.</p>
                <p>
                    <br />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>If conversion work or conveyor width adjustment is necessary for job B, the line is emptied and width adjustment is started for the conveyor:</p>
                <p>Perform the conversion work and confirm this operation by pressing the Start button.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Images/StationwiseDownload/SwdProduceB.png" />.<br /><br />If neither conversion work nor width adjustment are necessary, the boards for the new job B can be moved in and produced as soon as the last board from job A has been moved from the input section to the processing area. <img src="../Images/StationwiseDownload/SwdProduceB.png" />.</p>
                <p>
                    <br />The boards of job B remain in the machine until the job change has taken place on the downstream machine. This is done automatically. </p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Special case:</b> If a station needs to be restarted, <img src="../Images/StationwiseDownload/SwdConfirmMenu_Button.PNG" /> is displayed when a board moves into the downstream station. For each board that moves into the machine, you must specify whether it is the last board of job A. Do this by clicking the button and choosing the appropriate entry from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p>Only after the last board has been confirmed is the input conveyor locked, allowing you to proceed.</p>
