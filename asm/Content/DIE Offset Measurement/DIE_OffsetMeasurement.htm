        <h1><a name="kanchor203"></a>Front/back offset measurement </h1>
        <p>Inaccurate or oblique cut edges mean that determination of the position using the outline alone is inadequate for high-precision placement of dies. A new measurement step has therefore been introduced in which the die is measured both from the bottom and from the top.</p>
        <p>However, since this additional measurement step can have a negative impact on placement performance, it should only be carried out for selected dies of a wafer. The SIPLACE Wafer System or the Wafer.Map file can be used to specify which dies of a wafer are to be subject to this measurement. </p>
        <p>An average offset in X and Y is calculated from all the measured dies and applied when placing the remaining dies of a wafer.</p>
        <p>A prerequisite for this is that a specified percentage of the measurements was able to be performed successfully. If a single offset is determined to be greater than 10 Âµm, the die is flagged as an outlier and is rejected. This measurement is not taken into account when determining the average offset.</p>
