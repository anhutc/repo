        <h1>Hot swap</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>After the appropriate setup data has been assigned to an X-Feeder, it is possible to remove the X-Feeder and to set it up at a different position not used in the setup on the same X-Table without the assigned setup data being lost.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If the feeder to be set up at a different position is currently in use, it is recommended that the placement process be stopped in order to avoid pickup errors. After the position has been changed, the placement process is continued and the X-Feeder is used at its new position. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If component verification is activated for a feeder, it is not possible to "hot swap" this feeder, since the feeder track would no longer be correct after hot swapping and would need to be scanned again. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a feeder that is subject to component verification is nevertheless set up on a different track, it is not "hot swapped". Error messages are issued at the user interface indicating an incomplete setup, because the feeder that is now missing is treated as simply having been removed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Aktion">Note:</p>
        <p>The new position must not be occupied by another feeder, neither may it be specified in the setup.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a new feeder (2) is to be set up at the original position of the feeder (1) that has been moved using the hot swap function, feeder (2) is only used after feeder (1) has been removed.</p>
